# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles repository.

This repository contains configuration files used to set up and maintain my development environment.  

---

## About

These are my **personal configuration files** for tools I use regularly on Arch setup.

---

## Scope

This repository may include configurations for:

- Shells
- Editors
- Window managers
- Terminal tools
- Miscellaneous utilities

The exact contents change as my workflow changes.
This repo reflects how I work **right now**.

---

## Usage

This is **not** a plug-and-play setup.

If you intend to use anything from here:
1. Read the files.
2. Understand what they do.
3. Adapt them manually.

Blindly copying dotfiles is a good way to break your system.

## Notes

- Configs may be incomplete or in flux
- Some files may depend on tools you do not use
- Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed
- Breaking changes are acceptable

This is a living repository.
