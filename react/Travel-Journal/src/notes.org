# What does the `Array.map()` method do?
- It basically iterates over all the elements of the array and then returns an array with those modified elements.

# What do we usually use `.map()` for in React ?
- It is used to convert an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements that can be displayed on the page.

# Critical Thinking: Why is using '.map()' better than just creating the components manually by typing it out?
  - We don't have the data ahead of time when we're building the app,
    so we simply can't manually type them out.
    
  - It makes our code more "self-sustaining" not requiring additional
    changes to the code whenever the data changes.
