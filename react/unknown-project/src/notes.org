# What is Conditional Rendering ?
> It's when we want certain elements to show up based on the result of conditions that we have set.

# When would you use && ?
> `&&` is used when we want to render something if the condition is found to be true or else it returns null.

# When would you use a Ternary ?
> A ternary can be used when we want to render something based on the outcome, i.e. different renders would be done for if the condition was found
 to be true or false.

# What if you need to decide between > 2 options on what to display?
> I'd then simply implement a function and return the value inside the element i want to render.
