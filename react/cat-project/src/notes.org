# Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah=true`) to a native DOM element ? (e.g. <div>blahblahblah={true}</div>) Why or why not?
> No, because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will be turned into REAL DOM elements by react. And real DOM Elements by React. And real
DOM elements only have the properties/attributes specified in the HTML specification. (which doesn't include properties like `blahblahblah`)

# How do i recieve props in a component ?
> We can pass in props as a parameter to the component function and the use it like
 `{prop.someProperty}` and so on.
 
function Navbar(props){
<header>
....
</header>
}

# What data type is `props` when the component recieves it?
> An Object !, you can find that out by doing `console.log(props)`.
