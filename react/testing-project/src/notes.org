# In what way are react functions meant to be pure functions ?
- Given the same props or state, the component will always return
  the same content, or UI.

  - Rendering and re-rendering a component will never have any
    kind of side effect on an outside system.

# What is a "side effect" in React ? What are some examples ?
- Any code that affects or interacts with an outside system.
- localStorage, API, Websockets, DOM Manipulations
  
# What is not a side effect in React? Give some Examples ?
- Anything that react is incharge of
  - Maintaining State, keeping the UI in sync with data,
    rendering DOM elements.

# When does React run your useEffect function? When does it not run
# the effect function ?

- As soon as the component renders for the first time.
  - On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array).
    - Will NOT re-render if the values of the dependencies array stay same
      between renders.

# How would you explain what the dependencies array is ?
- Second parameter to the useEffect function.
  - A way for react to know whether or not it should re-run the effect function.
